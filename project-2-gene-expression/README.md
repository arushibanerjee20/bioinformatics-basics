Project 2: Exploratory RNA-Seq Analysis using PCA

This project analyzes public RNA-Seq gene expression data from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and healthy controls.

Raw gene count data were log-transformed and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce dimensionality. 
Each point in the PCA plot represents one individual sample, and samples are colored by condition (Healthy vs MS post-treatment).

The PCA visualization shows how samples cluster based on overall gene expression patterns, providing an overview of biological variation between conditions.

This project explores a public RNA-seq gene expression dataset from NCBI GEO (GSE60424).
Each GSM accession represents one biological sample from a human subject.
Selected samples for analysis:

Healthy controls:
- GSM1479433
- GSM1479438

MS post-treatment:
- GSM1479435
- GSM1479445

All samples are whole blood RNA-seq data from the GEO series GSE60424.

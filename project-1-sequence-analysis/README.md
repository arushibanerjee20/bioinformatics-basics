# Project 1: DNA Sequence Analysis (GC Content)

## Objective
To calculate the GC content of a DNA sequence using Python.

## Biological Background
GC content is an important genomic feature that affects DNA stability,
melting temperature, and gene regulation.

## Method
- User inputs a DNA sequence
- The script validates the sequence (A, T, G, C only)
- GC percentage is calculated using Python

## Tools Used
- Python

## Status
Completed
